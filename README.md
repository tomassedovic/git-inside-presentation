Git Inside Presentation
=======================

This is a talk I've given for [Aeolus Tech School][1] on the fundamentals of
how Git works.

It's about the internal representation (blobs, trees, commits) and where they
are stored. It doesn't cover the implementation details (how exactly are the
objects encoded before being stored) or the everyday git commands.

You can see the slides at

Created in [Showoff][2], diagrams made in [Balsamiq][3].
